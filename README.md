# Our process
First, we created one file where the code works in it's simplest form, we used simple, and sanity tests
<br/>
that will give a general indication of how the code should be.
<br/>
After that, we started the solid principles type refactoring phase where we split the code into
<br/>
classes with different roles, created h files and tested the code in depth while referring to edge cases.
Moreover, while moving, we updated the jira with tasks, sometimes tasks that we defined in advanceand sometimes
<br/>
things that we decided in light of a situation while, in order to conduct ourselves in a more orderly manner.
